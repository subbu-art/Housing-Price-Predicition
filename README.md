**Housing Prices Prediction Project**

This project is focused on predicting housing prices using two different datasets: the Ames Housing Dataset and the California Housing Dataset. We've employed online machine learning techniques, specifically Ridge Regression and Linear Regression, to make predictions based on the data.
Datasets
**1. Ames Housing Dataset**

  The Ames Housing Dataset is a comprehensive dataset that contains various features related to residential homes in Ames, Iowa.
  It consists of both numerical and categorical data, making it suitable for regression analysis.
  The dataset is used to predict house sale prices based on the provided features.

**2. California Housing Dataset**

  The California Housing Dataset contains data related to housing in California districts.
  It includes features such as median house value, income, population, and more.
  This dataset is utilized for regression analysis to predict median house values in different districts.

Online Machine Learning Models

In this project, we've employed two different online machine learning models for regression tasks:
**1. Ridge Regression**

  Ridge Regression is a regularized linear regression technique that helps prevent overfitting.
  It adds a penalty term to the linear regression cost function, which shrinks the coefficients towards zero.
  Ridge Regression is applied to both the Ames and California datasets to predict housing prices.
**2. Linear Regression**

  Linear Regression is a fundamental regression algorithm that aims to establish a linear relationship between the input features and the target variable.
  We've used Linear Regression for comparison with Ridge Regression in our predictions for both datasets.

Getting Started

To run this project and reproduce the results, follow these steps:

    Clone the repository to your local machine:

bash

git clone https://github.com/your-username/housing-prices-project.git
cd housing-prices-project

    Install the required Python packages. You can use a virtual environment for this:

bash

pip install -r requirements.txt

    Run the Jupyter notebooks or Python scripts provided in this repository to perform data preprocessing, train the models, and make predictions.

**Results**

We have achieved the following results in our housing prices prediction task:

    For the Ames Housing Dataset:
        Ridge Regression achieved an RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error) of 1.93.
        Linear Regression achieved an RMSE of 1.98.

    For the California Housing Dataset:
        Ridge Regression achieved an RMSE of 0.63.
        Linear Regression achieved an RMSE of X.64.

These results indicate the effectiveness of Ridge Regression in improving prediction accuracy compared to simple Linear Regression.
Acknowledgments
